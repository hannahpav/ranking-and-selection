# Ranking and Selection
Different Ranking and Selection techniques on Three Simulations

## Abstract
This paper uses three Ranking and Selection Procedures to choose optimal systems for finding lowest Inventory costs, highest profit in a Bottle Filling System, and lowest cost at a Truck Weigh Station. The three procedures are: Selecting the best of k systems - Dudewicz and Dalal procedure, Selecting a subset of size m containing the best of k systems - Koening and Law procedure, and Nelson and Matejcik (NM) procedure.

Ultimately, the subset m of k systems proved to be the optimal method because it required the least amount of replications, and thus was the least computationally expensive. The NM method also saw advantages in its ease of use, while the DD method would have an advantage if it started from a place of expert opinion, thus negating the need for the first iteration in the best m of k procedure.

## Models
Subset of m models:
Subset m of k airport queueing system --> trying to find the best subset for queueing using the method from section 3
Subset m of k - manufacturing system --> trying to find the best subset for bottling using the method from section 3
Subset m of k - inventory model --> trying to find the best subset for inventory system using the method from section 3

Selecting best system - inventory model --> trying to find the best subset for inventory system using the method from section 2
Selecting best system - bottling system --> trying to find the best subset for bottling system using the method from section 2
Airport queueing system - copy1 --> trying to find the best subset for queueing system using the method from section 2

model --> model for the inventory system
Bottling line v6 --> model for the bottling system 

Nelson and Matejcik - bottling system --> trying to find the best subset for bottling using the method from section 4
Nelson and Matejcik - stock system --> trying to find the best subset for inventory system using the method from section 4
Nelson and Matejcik - manufacturing system --> trying to find the best subset for bottling system using the method from section 4
